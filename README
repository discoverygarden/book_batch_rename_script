SUMMARY
-------

Renames a folder full of TIFF/XML/MRC files and moves them into the correct
folders to prepare for ingest using the Islandora Book Batch module

The batch renaming script needs the following setup to ensure it functions
correctly:

 - A folder must be created containing all of the TIFF files for a single book.
 - Optionally, an XML or MRC metadata file containing MODS, DC or MARCXML
   metadata may be placed in that same folder.
 - The TIFF files in the folder must be sequentially named, page to page, in
   alphabetical order, not numerical order. This means, importantly, that the
   files must be listed, for example, as 001.tif, 002.tif, ... 009.tif, 010.tif,
   and NOT as 1.tif, 2.tif, ... 9.tif, 10.tif. In the former case, pages would
   be sorted correctly, whereas in the latter, pages would be sorted as 1, 10,
   2, ... 9
 - A copy of rename_script.bat or rename_script.sh, depending on your operating
   system (see requirements below), must be pasted into the folder and then run

The script will ask for the name of the book. This will become the folder name
that all the pages will be placed in

After the batch script creates the folder, the folder itself will need to be
moved to a .zip file. Each subsequent book created with the batch renaming
script may be placed in the same .zip file.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
rename_script.bat runs in Windows, and will work without any configuration on
Windows NT or higher.

rename_script.sh runs in Mac OS X and Linux; you will need to give it
executable permissions (for example, by running chmod +x on it). It needs to
be run through the standard terminal emulator; because of this, simply double-
clicking on it may not work.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

Module Dependencies:
 - islandora_book_batch
 - islandora_batch
 - islandora_importer

rename_script.bat runs in Windows, and will work without any configuration on Windows NT or higher.

Ingesting batches of books into Islandora requires:
 - islandora_batch
 - islandora_book_batch
 - islandora_importer (if uploading from within Islandora as a .zip)

INSTALLATION
------------
Place the file that matches your operating system in the folder full of book
files, and then run it from there. Only do one book at a time; do not place
multiple books in the same folder.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
The most common reason for the script failing is that filenames in your folder
aren't correct. Again, check that they are in alphabetical order, NOT numerical.
It is best to place the numbering just before the extension. Also, be sure to
check that filenames are consistent outside of your numbering.
